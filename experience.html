            <p>Over the last few years, I've had the pleasure of performing in a variety of roles as I explored my industry at large. My undergraduate lessons in User Experience Design were both the inspiration and reaffirmation of my ultimate goal - understanding people's needs and experiences in digital media and technology. The following is the culmination of my personal experiences over the last 4 years.</p>

                    <h5>2019-2020</h5>
    				<p>Perhaps my greatest challenge so far. It is greatly benefiting my knowledge in research methods, user centred design and opening my eyes to the broader issues within HCI and that people face every day. Design and Research practice is greatly teaching me the importance of working in a research team and appropriately applying my learning to the real world. Advanced Topics in HCI is teaching me about the absolute limits of our knowledge in the field, and broadening my horizons as to the complexity of issues that consumers of technology face. During the summer, my final challenge will be writing my full thesis - pushing the limits of my knowledge, self-motivation and organisational skills. I hope to produce a deeply insightful and knowledge-pushing paper.</p>

                    <h5>2016-2019</h5>
    				<p>I have always loved digital media, and as such a media degree always seemed like the right choice. What I didn’t expect was the extent to which I’d be exposed to the business operations of big tech companies and the development side of creating meaningful digital products. As such, I spent 3 years performing an extremely broad range of activities. From Project Management to Web Design, Film Making to Blogging, User Experience Design to Social Science; I’ve been provided a broad skillset that has allowed me to explore different aspects of the industry in both a team and individualistic sense.</p>

                   <h3>Manchester Metropolitain Unversity</h3>
                    <h5>2018-2020</h5>
    				<p>From my teenage days I’ve always been editing videos. This job opportunity came to me during my study and it lead to a healthy relationship with the university as I co-managed their marketing campaign “This is Manchester”. This required immense self-motivation to edit typically 10 videos optimised for both mobile timelines and widescreen online video. Through this experience I reinforced my editing skills and really learned the value of time-keeping, as I would aim to reach the deadlines imposed by my employer. Collaborating with university staff while maintaining my study was a gratifying, communication-driven challenge.</p>

    				<p>Technology has always been of deep interest to me, so this job for the university business school seemed like a no-brainer. I was enrolled as support staff, managing the technological needs of thousands of students and hundreds of staff. Replacing devices, maintaining machines and answering the calls of my peers was a great team-building experience that deepened my knowledge of tech and exposed my to the real issues users face every day. I believe this to be one of the invaluable experiences that lead to my passion for User Experience.</p>

                    <h5>2016-2017</h5>
    				<p>My first ever job in digital and one that's deceptively simple from the name. I was enlisted by a small start-up agency as their dedicated blogger and content writer for companies that required my expertise. I would be asked to write stories about topics that often I had no knowledge about, which lead to deep self-research and a deeper understanding about agency culture. Time management and communication was key, as was self-reflection as I'd get my first taste of real criticism. This was one of the key experiences that I believe made me an excellent communicator, both in conversation and in writing.</p>

                    <h5>August 2017</h5>
    				<p>A temporary role I filled for the clearing-lines at the university. This included working in a team to log the data of prospective students and their corresponding course. This was ultimately a position that required me to both work at a fast pace and have an eye for detail - as mistakes were deemed completely unacceptable. A challenging yet rewarding experience.</p>

    				<p>A role that required me to consider the thoughts and feelings of course mates and relay said thoughts to the department staff at meetings. In a sense, I was the primary link between the students needs and the understanding of those needs from the perspective of the staff members. My greatest achievement was co-introducing a more rigerous evaluation system of the course. This was really a test of my emotional intelligence, as I had to really consider the feelings of everyone involved with the department.</p>

    				<p>Working open days and events, I performed in a team of students to both promote the university and the my own respective course. This was really a test of my communication skills as I relayed issues to the team and spoke with prospective students with their parents. The relaxed nature of this role made this fun side-work, while also developing my interpersonal skills.</p>
